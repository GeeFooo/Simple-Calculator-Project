Build a Simple Calculator | Project | Python

I just build a simple calculator using Tkinter and add sin , tan , cos and square root operations.

For sin , tan , cos , you just need to input degree numbers and the program will convert to radians and do the calculation.

For example , user input sin 60 means 60 degree , program will first convert it to 60° × π/180 = 1.047rad . After that , sin 1.047rad = 0.86592661128 as well as tan and cos.
